== Migration to Shadow-cljs / tools deps

* slim down tooling
* slim down config
* better interop with npm

== Development

To get an interactive development environment run:

npx shadow-cljs watch app

This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. 

To create a production build run:

npx shadow-cljs release app
